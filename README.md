# About 

##  Browser Web Cam

This project is a straightforward web application that allows users to access their webcam and take a photo with a single click. Built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it demonstrates how to use the browser's native getUserMedia() API to request camera access, display a live video preview, and capture a still image.

# Acknowledgements

This simple project serves as a practical example for beginners learning how to interact with webcams in web development. It can be used as a foundation for more advanced applications like photo booths, identity verification, or creative camera-based web apps.
